## Abstract
Scobo is an advanced robot designed to revolutionize the healthcare industry. Developed by the Rotonity Club, Scobo aims to ease doctors' workloads and enhance patient care through cutting-edge technology. It features a sophisticated Pill Dispensing System that streamlines medication management, ensuring accurate and timely delivery of prescribed medications. With a simple click from the doctor's interface, Scobo dispenses pills, minimizing errors and increasing medication adherence. Additionally, Scobo's Video Chat functionality enables live consultations, bridging geographical barriers.

## Introduction
In the fast-paced world of healthcare, professionals face challenges like high patient volumes, limited time, and geographical barriers. Scobo envisions a world where distance and access to healthcare are no longer obstacles. It enables doctors to seamlessly connect with remote patients, offering diagnoses, advice, and care without physical limitations.

Scobo is a game-changing solution that overcomes traditional healthcare limitations. Through a web-based interface, doctors can conduct real-time consultations, assess symptoms, and discuss treatment plans. The robot's pill dispensing system optimizes medication management, reducing errors and enhancing adherence.

## Working
Scobo's operation is backed by a Django backend that connects it to the internet, enabling communication with the web-based interface. The user interface, hosted online, lets doctors interact with Scobo, manage consultations, and dispense medication remotely.

Scobo's physical actions are executed via a NodeMCU microcontroller within the robot. This device receives instructions from the website and controls Scobo's mechanical components. The robot's design accommodates a pill dispensing system. As the NodeMCU gets medication details, it activates servo motors that open passages for precise pill dispensing.

## Benefits and Impact
Scobo offers several benefits:

1. **Improved Medication Adherence:** Automating pill dispensing reduces errors and improves adherence to treatment plans.
2. **Time Efficiency for Professionals:** With pill dispensing automated, healthcare providers can focus on critical tasks.
3. **Enhanced Patient-Doctor Interaction:** Video calls enable remote consultations, saving time and costs.
4. **Reduced Healthcare Costs:** Automation minimizes errors and optimizes workflow, cutting costs.

## Conclusion
Scobo, developed by the Rotonity Club, is a leap forward in healthcare technology. It breaks geographical barriers, enhances patient care, and optimizes healthcare delivery. Scobo envisions a future where medical expertise is accessible to all, regardless of distance. Its pill dispensing system and potential for autonomy promise further advancements in patient care. With Scobo, Rotonity Club has transformed healthcare into a more accessible, efficient, and patient-centric landscape. The robot represents the future of healthcare, where technology and innovation empower professionals and improve patient outcomes.
